# We have GitHub and Git, GitHub is a cloud server that enables users to add and updated projects into a repository.
# Git is the most popular VCS (version control system).
# A version control system records the changed made to a code toa database called repository.
# It is possible to make changes when and what was changed, without a c version control system it makes out work very slow.
# tracking system and working together effectively is possible with Git.
# Git is a distributed system, GIT AND MERCURIAL.

# Git has commands such as Git Status, Git add, Git add ., Git commit, Git commit -m"", Git push etc.
# Ultimately what you want to do is to update the LOCAL REPOSITORY and finally push it to Remote repository.
